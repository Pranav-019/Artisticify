              <h4>1.Keyword Research</h4>
              <p className='text text-secondary'>Keyword research is the foundation of SEO. By identifying and targeting the right keywords that your audience is searching for, you can create content that meets their needs. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to find keywords with high search volume and low competition. By optimizing your content around these keywords, you increase your chances of ranking higher on search engines and attracting relevant traffic.</p>
              <h4>2.Content Optimization</h4>
              <p className='text text-secondary'>Content optimization ensures that your website is providing valuable and high-quality information to your visitors. Make sure your content is relevant, engaging, and answers the questions your target audience is asking. Use your keywords strategically in headings, meta descriptions, and throughout your content. Additionally, focus on creating content that satisfies user intent, as Google ranks content that is useful and provides value to readers.</p>
              <h4>3.Mobile Responsiveness</h4>
              <p className='text text-secondary'>With the increasing number of users accessing websites from mobile devices, having a mobile-responsive website is crucial for SEO. Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in its rankings. Ensure that your website design is adaptable to different screen sizes, loads quickly, and provides a seamless browsing experience across devices. A mobile-responsive site improves both user experience and SEO rankings.</p>
              <h4>4.Link Building</h4>
              <p className='text text-secondary'>Link building is the practice of getting other websites to link back to your site. These backlinks act as endorsements, signaling to search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. Focus on acquiring high-quality, relevant backlinks from reputable sites in your industry. This not only improves your SEO but also drives referral traffic to your site, boosting visibility and credibility.</p>
              <h4>5.Technical SEO</h4>
              <p className='text text-secondary'>Technical SEO focuses on improving the backend structure of your website, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content. This includes optimizing site speed, improving URL structures, fixing broken links, creating an XML sitemap, and using schema markup. A well-optimized website ensures that search engines can easily navigate and rank your pages, resulting in better visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
